# To Do List

This is not quite a road map but a running task list:

- [ ] Fix toolbar location on large screens.
- [ ] Refine stylesheets.
- [ ] Bring the proofreading style sheet up to date.
- [ ] Transfer css from templates to stylesheets.
- [ ] Enable `unclear`, `add`, and `del` toggles.
- [ ] Refine metadata template.
- [ ] Trigger metadata source from open document.
- [ ] Add links from msItems in metadata to load folios in the viewer.*
- [ ] Test with whole codex.
- [ ] Finalise copy of static pages.
- [ ] Define copyright/licensing issues.
- [ ] Create system for additional static material (e.g. editorial introductions).
- [ ] Double check how notes display.
- [ ] Determine how named entities will be handled.

\* Note. It should be possible to grab the first folio in the locus element and call `loadPage` on that.
