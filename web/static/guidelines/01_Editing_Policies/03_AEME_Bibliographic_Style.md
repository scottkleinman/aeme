# AEME Bibliographic Style

Bibliographic references should be given in *Chicago Manual of Style*, 16th edition format if they are unstructured (e.g. complete references in a `<p>` element). Structured bibliographic references should generally contain all the same information. Titles should enclosed in `<title>` tags where they would normally be rendered in italics in a print publication.
