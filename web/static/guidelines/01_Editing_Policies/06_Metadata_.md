The primary encoding of metadata will be placed within the `<teiHeader>` sections of the document TEI file. AEME requires the minimum set of metadata elements specified in this document.
AEME also maintains directories containing metadata files for easy interoperability with resources such as [TAPAS](http://tapasproject.org), [MESA](http://www.mesa-medieval.org/), and [Manuscripts Online](http://www.manuscriptsonline.org/). At the time of writing, AEME expects to maintain RDF files for [MESA](http://www.mesa-medieval.org/) and the Dublin Core files generated by [TAPAS](http://tapasproject.org). Other metadata options may be added at a later date.
