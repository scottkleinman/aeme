Saints’ names can often go by multiple spellings. For consistency, AEME uses spellings from David Hugh Farmer, David Hugh. *The Oxford Dictionary of Saints*. 5th edition Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003. If the saint is not listed in Farmer, a secondary reference is Cross, F. L., and E. A. Livingstone. *The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church*. 3rd Revised edition. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. Each saint should receive a unique `@xml:id` in AEME’s list of named entities, and editors should adopt a consistent spelling in notes and discussion. However, editors should be aware that in some cases English spellings of names, such as for Welsh or Irish saints, may have political implications and are urged to account for these factors.
