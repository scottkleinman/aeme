# `physDesc`

The `<physDesc>` element contains a physical description of the manuscript or manuscript part. The discussion here assumes a full codex. See the TEI docs for encoding of manuscript parts. `<physDesc>` is used to define all hands and scripts present in the manuscript, as well as any decorative elements that are unusual or not easily encoded.
