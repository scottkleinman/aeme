# `decoDesc`

The `<decoDesc>` element contains a description of the decoration of a manuscript. It can be structured, but for AEMEâ€™s minimal schema, a sequence of paragraphs containing notes about distinctive decorative features should be sufficient. See Rubricated and Other Color-Highlighted Words and Phrases, and Otherwise Highlighted Text.
