The `<teiHeader>` element is the container for the documentâ€™s metadata. AEME requires a fairly standard set of child elements within the `<teiHeader>`, and the reader is referred to the TEI documentation for details. The following sections outline the required elements and their order, as well as some AEME-specific values required in certain sections.

### Required Child Elements
`<fileDesc>`, `<encodingDesc>`, `<profileDesc>`

### Optional Child Elements
`<revisionDesc>`
