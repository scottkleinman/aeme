          "text": "# Introduction\n\nThis document is a reference for editors who are encoding texts for the Archive of Early Middle English (AEME). All files submitted to the Archive must conform to the minimal Guidelines in the document. Encoding not specified in the Guidelines is allowable but may not be visible in the rendered texts on the AEME web platform.\n\nAEME texts are encoded in the XML markup schema of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), following the <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/\" target=\"_blank\">TEI P5 Guidelines</a>. In general, AEME sticks closely to the usage in TEI\u2019s base modules with a few customisations. This document will note where AEME places limits on the larger set of allowable TEI elements and attributes. Where vocabulary and constraints are drawn from TEI, this document provides minimal explanation, particularly for possible child elements and attributes of many TEI elements. Editors should click the links to relevant TEI elements in order to read the appropriate TEI documentation.\n\nThese Guidelines do not represent a full statement of AEME editorial policy but they attempt to place encoding practices specific to AEME within the context of the editorial policy of the project.\n\n## Some History\nThe initial draft is based primarily on the guidelines of the <a href=\"http://ccl/rch/uky.edu/using-TEI\" target=\"_blank\">Carolingian Canon Law Project</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.menota.org/HB_index.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Medieval Nordic Text Archive (Menota)</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/seenet/piers/protocoltran.html\" target=\"_blank\">*Piers Plowman Electronic Archive*</a>. AEME is gradually removing material derived from these projects.\n\n## The Document Model\nIn AEME, each manuscript is conceived as a document object (or \u201cdocument\u201d, for short). This is to be distinguished from the genre of written texts often classified as \u201cdocumentary\u201d (e.g. legal and administrative texts). An AEME document is a digital object representing a manuscript that can be viewed in several ways, or views, in the AEME platform. These may be summarized as follows:\n\n* Image View: A digital photograph of the manuscript.\n* Facsimile View: A TEI-encoded representation of the manuscript\u2019s codicological features, layout, illustrations, and other non-textual elements.\n* Diplomatic View: A close transcription of the text components of the manuscript with minimal editorial intervention.\n* Critical View: A transcription of the text components of the manuscript with greater editorial intervention, including most critical notes and references.\n\nEach AEME document file must contain code to enable the rendering of a facsimile view, a diplomatic view, and a critical view of the manuscript. Image view is not required since digital images may not be available. Other types of views such as glossaries and translations may also be included, but these are not strictly part of the document representation.\n\nAEME documents are divided into pages, each representing one side of a manuscript leaf. In the AEME platform, users may examine different views of individual pages side by side or superimpose one over another.\n\n## Some More History\nAEME initially adopted Menota\u2019s division among three types of transcriptions, to be kept distinct by separate XML namespaces. As time passed, it became clear that a faithful facsimile rendering of the manuscript page was a tall order, and that what was really needed was a mock-up of the non-textual elements of the page in case no image was available. At the same time, TEI P5 has proven mostly adequate to combine codicological features with diplomatic and critical markup. Hence it was no longer necessary to keep the encoding for diplomatic and critical representations of the text strictly separate. Layout remains a troublesome issue, and AEME is exploring image annotation models (e.g. <a href=\"http://iiif.io/\" target=\"_blank\">SharedCanvas</a>) as one means of recording this information.\n\n**Note on terminology:** A legacy of earlier usage has been the loose use of the terms \u201crepresentation\u201d and \u201clayer\u201d (e.g. \u201cthe critical representation\u201d, \u201cthe facsimile layer\u201d). These terms should now be avoided. Instead, we should discuss the \u201cviews\u201d listed above, referring to the content that will appear to the user on the front end of the AEME platform. The terms \u201cmarkup\u201d or \u201cencoding\u201d (e.g. \u201cthe critical markup\u201d, \u201cthe facsimile encoding\u201d) should be used to refer to the code from which this content is generated. Terms like this should refer to markup primarily, though not exclusively, to be used to generate the equivalent type of view.\n\nA related issue is the distinction between \u201ctranscription\u201d as an activity of recording textual content, as well as the record itself, and \u201cedition\u201d which is the object presented to the public. Both the diplomatic and critical views are \u201ceditions\u201d or \u201cedited transcriptions\u201d, that is, texts containing editorial interventions described in our editorial policies and these Guidelines.\n\n## Some Conventions Used in This Document\nExamples in this documentation may contain notation like `$TBD`. The dollar sign indicates that the value is a placeholder that will be replaced by some real value from the project. XML elements are always given in angular brackets, and attributes are referenced with `@` prefixed to the attribute name.\n",

          "text": "# File Naming and Organisation\n\n\n\nSince AEME edits at the codex level, it makes sense to assemble one file per codex (or equivalent). It is possible to have multiple interim/working files for individual texts.\n\nFilenames will be composed from the information in the `<collection>` and `<idno>` elements of the `<msDesc>` element. Information in `<collection>` should be converted to lower case and may be abbreviated.\n\n\n\nIf there is no `<collection>` information, the material in `<repository>` should be used with the same abbreviation rules. For example: \u201cbodllaudmisc108.xml\u201d for Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. MS 108; \u201csalisc82.xml\u201d for Salisbury Cathedral, MS 82. Note that multi-college institutions like Oxford and Cambridge should contain prefixes like \u201cox\u201d and \u201ccam\u201d before the college names. Some manuscripts contain punctuation marks in their shelf ID numbers. These should be changed to underscores. If there are multiple files, the suffix `-01`, `-02`, etc. can be added before the xml extension.\n\n\n\nAEME maintains a working table of equivalents for abbreviations and full `<collection>` values.\n\nImage files will be formed from the equivalent transcription filename (minus the xml extension) combined and the image filename delivered by the holding repository. The transcription filename and the image filename will be divided by `_img_`. For example, `laudmisc108_img_0001.tif`, `salisc82_img_salisc0082.tif`.\n\n\n\nNote that this may provide a little bit of redundancy, but it ensures that the filename, which may be meaningless, is always accompanied by information about the manuscript from which the image is taken.\n\n\n\nTEI and image files will be maintained in separate directories.\n\n",

          "text": "# `xml:id` Values\n\n\n\nTEI\u2019s `@xml:id` is used to create a canonical reference to be used for processing. Since it is not seen by the reader on the front end, its value may be entirely arbitrary, but AEME recommends assigning values that are at least somewhat human readable. This serves as a finding aid and is helpful for anyone re-using the code in the future. The value of an `@xml:id` attribute should be unique within a file. However, it is frequently useful for named entities to have unique values used consistently across the Archive. AEME maintains a named entity file for this purpose. At present, AEME has not fully developed conventions for `@xml:id` values to be used universally. So far, values for persons are prefixed with `bio`, values for places with `loc`, and values for organisations with `org`. For example, `bioGO001` refers to Sharon Goetz (using the first two letters of her surname). These conventions may become more rigorous as content increases in the Archive.\n\n\n\nFor bibliographical references, the `@xml:id` should be formed from the surname of the author and the date of publication. Ambiguous names can use the author\u2019s initial (e.g. `HorstmannC1873`). Multiple publications from the same year can be indicated with a suffixed number (e.g. `Horstmann1873-1`). Other identifiers (e.g. based on ISBNs or DOIs) may be used of the author-date conventions are not appropriate. The only requirement is that Bibliographical `@xml:id` values must be unique within the file, but, in practice, it should also be unique across the Archive, drawn from a stand-off document. These may be accessed using `@corresp` in a `<ref>` or `<bibl>` element.\n\n\n\nStandard TEI P5 practice is to indicate languages by attaching `@xml:lang` to appropriate elements (e.g. `<seg xml:lang=\"enm\">`). AEME follows MESA in requiring the use of language codes from the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 639-2 Language Code List</a>. The value of `@xml:lang` must be from the first column (ISO 639-2 Code).\n\n",

The discussion below describes a TEI P5-compliant template that must be used as the basis for each document object file.\n\nFiles must begin with an appropriate XML declaration and an AEME namespace declaration. If character entity aliases are used, they must be defined using DTD subsets. For example:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE TEI[\n<!ENTITY yogh \"&#x021D;\">\n]>\n<TEI xml:id=\"$TBD\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\" xmlns:aeme=\"http://aeme.emesoc.org/ns/1.0\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://aeme.emesoc.org/schema/aeme.rng\">\n...\n</TEI>\n```\n\nLine 1 declares the document to be xml and the character encoding to be UTF-8 (Unicode). Lines 2-4 declare an alias for the Unicode code point for yogh: `&#x021D;` using a DTD subset. This ensures that instances of `&yogh;` in the file will be replaced by the Unicode character for yogh in any output. See the section on [Representation of Individual Characters and Glyphs](\u001d/Encoding_Policies/Representation_of_Characters_and_Glyphs) for further details.\n\nLine 5 begins the TEI document, declaring the TEI namespace as well as the AEME namespace. This will serve to disambiguate any overlap between standard TEI and custom AEME uses. The content of the TEI document is contained between lines 5 and 7.\n\nNote: We are not currently using the AEME namespace, so `@xmlns:aeme` may be omitted.\nThe use of `@xml:id` in the `<TEI>` tag is a useful hook for output processing. The value should match the filename minus the `.xml` extension, e.g. `bodllaudmisc108`.\n\nThe primary encoding of metadata will be placed within the `<teiHeader>` section at the top of the `<TEI>` element. Standard single-text files will be composed of a `<teiHeader>` element, a `<facsimile>` element, and a `<text>` element. Elements containing glossaries or other editorial apparatus may be produced in separate files during the draft stage but should be placed in a single file prior to publication.\n",

The distinction should be formally encoded using the `<choice>`, `<orig>`, and `<reg>` elements.

Likewise, letters capitalised in the manuscript may be rendered lowercase\u2014following modern typographic practices\u2014in the critical view at the editor\u2019s discretion.

Entities for many common medieval punctuation marks are listed in AEME\u2019s `Character_Entities.xlsx` spreadsheet.\n\nIt is common practice in modern editions to replace medieval punctuation marks with common \u201cequivalents\u201d (that is, modern symbols that the editor deems to be an acceptable substitute). It is also common to introduce modern punctuation marks to aid the modern reader in parsing the syntactic (or sometimes metrical) structure of the text. These practices should only ever take place in the critical view and should be formally separated from diplomatic markup as described below. Editors should document their policy on editorially supplied punctuation in the `<teiHeader>` and follow it consistently.\n\nThe AEME schema incorporates the `<pc>` element from the TEI Analysis module to identify non-editorially supplied punctuation. All untagged punctuation is assumed to be supplied by the modern editor for display in the critical view only. Where a punctuation mark in the diplomatic view is to be rendered differently in the critical view, the critical reading should be placed in `@rend`. The following examples illustrate usage.\n\n```xml\n<!-- Punctuation in Diplomatic View only -->\nSome text<pc>&punctelev;</pc> and some more text\n\n<!-- Same Punctuation in Diplomatic and Critical Views -->\nSome text<pc rend=\".\">.</pc>\n\n<!-- Different Punctuation in Diplomatic and Critical Views -->\nSome text<pc rend=\",\">&punctelev;</pc> and some more text\n\n<!-- Punctuation in Critical View only -->\nSome text, and some more text\n```\n\nNote that the scenario in which a modern punctuation mark is to replace a medieval punctuation mark in the critical view presents a minor processing difficulty if the medieval symbol is preceded by space. This is not the convention in modern typography. The easiest solution is to delete white space before medieval punctuation marks (and therefore before `<pc>` in the encoding), as demonstrated in the examples above. For this practice in a diplomatic edition, see M.J. Driscoll, \u201cElectronic Textual Editing: Levels of Transcription\u201d, in Unsworth, O\u2019Brien O\u2019Keeffe, and Burnard, *Electronic Textual Editing* (http://www.tei-c.org/About/Archive_new/ETE/Preview/driscoll.xml). In certain cases, the editor may wish to preserve white space before a punctuation mark in the diplomatic view. In these cases, AEME recommends embedding the space within `<pc>`. For instance, one might wish to preserve the space around a *punctus elevatus* marking a caesura. This would be encoded as\n\n```xml\nSome text<pc> &punctelev;</pc> and some more text\n```\n\n`<pc>` may also take `@type=\"caesura\"` to indicate that the punctuation mark represents a half-line divider. In this case, no internal space is required because we can achieve the same effect by styling elements of this type with a margin on either side. The code would then look like this:\n\n```xml\n<pc type=\"caesura\">&punctelev;</pc>\n```\n\nCurrently, the use of `@type=\"caesura\"` is optional in AEME editions. No other possible values for `@type` have been proposed.",

This use of `<sg/>` can be converted to standard TEI structures in a number of ways:\n\n1. ```xml\na<gap reason=\"shadowHyphen\"/>bout\n```\n2. ```xml\na<sic> </sic>bout\n```\n3. ```xml \n<choice>\n\t<orig>a bout</orig>\n\t<reg>about</reg>\n</choice>\n```\n\nIn the first example, the term \u201cshadowHyphen\u201d is borrowed from the [*Piers Plowman Electronic Archive*](http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/seenet/piers/protocoltran.html) and implies that the gap is a semantic unit that some modern editors (but not AEME) choose to replace with a hyphen.\n\nWhere the gap is the direct result of a line break, the line break becomes the content of `<sg/>` (which, being no longer an empty element, requires a closing tag):\n\n```xml\na<sg><lb/></sg>bout\n```\n\nIt is possible to use `<sg/>` to indicate morphological separations of more than a single space by using `@quantity`. Hence `a<sg quantity=\"2\"/>bout` would indicate that the gap after a consists of two spaces.\n\n# `<sg/>` for Separating Morphological Elements\n\nMedieval manuscripts also frequently combine morphological elements which are treated as separate words in modern orthography. In these instances, the editor may choose to render them as separate words in the critical view. In such cases, `<sg/>` functions like the TEI `<supplied>` element. For example, the editor may wish \u201catones\u201d to appear as \u201cat ones\u201d in the critical view. This is achieved by the use of `<sg> </sg>`.\n\n```xml\nat<sg> </sg>ones\n```\n\nThe `<sg/>` element will be ignored by the stylesheet for the diplomatic view. This is formally equivalent to the following TEI structures:\n\n1. ```xml\nat<supplied reason=\"wordBreak\"/>ones\n```\n2. ```xml\n<choice>\n\t<orig>atones</orig>\n\t<reg>at ones</reg>\n</choice>\n```\n\nThe term \u201cwordBreak\u201d above is an arbitrary one adopted for the purposes of exemplification. It should be noted that the `<sg/>` content need not be a space. It is also possible to use, for example, a hyphen: `at<sg>-</sg>ones`. The precise content of the `<sg/>` is at the editor\u2019s discretion.\n\n# `<sg/>` for *Litterae Notabiliores*\n\nA special case may be made for gaps between the first letter of a line and the rest of the word. Line-initial letters are often positioned in a separate column to function as *litterae notabiliores*. AEME recognizes this conceptual distinction by the use of `@type=\"ln\"`. Hence, at the beginning of a line \u201cA bout\u201d would be encoded as `<l>A<sg type=\"ln\"/>bout\u2026</l>`. White space after `<sg type=\"ln\"/>` will be retained in the diplomatic view.",

          "text": "# Abbreviations\n\nThe discussion below demonstrates how TEI P5 may be used to main separate markup for the diplomatic and critical views. TEI P5 provides two groups of abbreviation tags: `<abbr>` and `<expan>` for abbreviations that should be expanded to whole words, and `<am>` and `<ex>` for abbreviation markers that are expanded alone. The use of the former implies a separation between diplomatic and critical markup.\n\n```xml\n<choice>\n    <abbr>pp</abbr>\n    <expan>propter</expan>\n</choice>\n```\nIf the initial *p* were flourished, it could be represented with an entity like `&#xA753;` (`&pflour;`). If there is a need to represent the *p*-flourish and the *p* as separate abbreviation makers, they should be placed in separate `<am>` tags instead.\n\n`<am>` and `<ex>` can exist within `<orig>` and `<reg>` tags. This is particularly important for cases like the word \u201cprophetes\u201d beginning with a *p*-flourish:\n\n```xml\n<choice>\n\t<orig><am>&pflour;</am>phetes</orig>\n\t<reg><ex ref=\"#g_pflour\">pro</ex>phetes</reg>\n</choice>\n```\n\nHere the `<orig>` element contains the diplomatic reading of the abbreviation mark. However, it can be toggled with the expanded form housed in the `<reg>` element (since the expansion is also what we would want to see in the critical view). The `@ref` value may be used to reference a *p*-flourish glyph that has been defined in `<encodingDesc>` (see the <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-g.html\" target=\"_blank\">TEI Guidelines for &lt;g&gt;</a>).\n",

These can be viewed by comparing the two witnesses side by side.\n\nAEME avoids the use of the TEI `<certainty>` element and instead indicates degrees of certainty by attaching `@cert` to the above elements.\n\nThe functions of the above elements overlap, and some of them can be nested. AEME editors are encouraged to read closely the TEI documentation on the use of these elements in combination. Its recommendations are important enough to summarize here.\n\n* Where the text has been rendered completely illegible by deletion or damage and no text is supplied by the editor in place of what is lost: place an empty `<gap>` element at the point of deletion or damage. Use the `@reason` attribute to state the cause (damage, deletion, etc.) of the loss of text.\n* Where the text has been rendered completely illegible by deletion or damage and text is supplied by the editor in place of what is lost: surround the text supplied at the point of deletion or damage with the `<supplied>` element. Use the `@reason` attribute to state the cause (damage, deletion, etc.) of the loss of text leading to the need to supply the text.\n* Where the text has been rendered partly illegible by deletion or damage so that the text can be read but without perfect confidence: transcribe the text and surround it with the `<unclear>` element. Use the `@reason` attribute to state the cause (damage, deletion, etc.) of the uncertainty in transcription and the `@cert` attribute to indicate the confidence in the transcription.\n* Where there is deletion or damage but at least some of the text can be read with perfect confidence: transcribe the text and surround it with the `<del>` element (for deletion) or the `<damage>` element (for damage). Use appropriate attribute values to indicate the cause and type of deletion or damage. Observe that the `@degree` attribute on the `<damage>` element permits the encoding to show that a letter, word, or phrase is not perfectly preserved, though it may be read with confidence.\n* Where there is an area of deletion or damage and parts of the text within that area can be read with perfect confidence, other parts with less confidence, other parts not at all: in transcription, surround the whole area with the `<del>` element (for deletion; or the `<delSpan>` element where it crosses a structural boundary); or the `<damage>` element (for damage). Text within the damaged area that can be read with perfect confidence needs no further tagging. Text within the damaged area that cannot be read with perfect confidence may be surrounded with the `<unclear>` element. Places within the damaged area where the text has been rendered completely illegible and no text is supplied by the editor may be marked with the `<gap>` element. For each element, one may use appropriate attribute values to indicate the cause and type of deletion or damage and the certainty of the reading.\n\nEach of the above elements may take a number of attributes. AEME has not yet developed its own taxonomy of values for these attributes. The following, derived mostly from the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, are provided for reference.\n\n### Attributes for `<gap>`:\n\n* `@reason`: Gives the reason for the omission. Standard attribute values are \u201cill-formed\u201d, \u201ctorn\u201d, \u201cfaded\u201d, \u201crubbed\u201d, \u201csmeared\u201d, \u201coverbound\u201d, and \u201cstained\u201d.\n* `@hand`: In the case of text omitted from the transcription because of deliberate deletion by an identifiable hand, indicates the hand that made the deletion, where determinable.\n* `@agent`: In the case of text omitted because of damage, categorizes the cause of the damage, if it can be identified. Standard attribute values are \u201cwater\u201d, \u201cmildew\u201d, and \u201csmoke\u201d.\n* `@quantity`: The extent of missing text in terms of the quantity of units specified in `@unit`.\n* `@unit`: The type of unit used to measure missing text (e.g. \u201cletters\u201d or \u201cmillimeters\u201d).\n\n### Attributes for `<del>`:\n* `@rend`: Indicates how the deletion was made in the text. Standard attribute values are \u201csubpunction\u201d, \u201cerasure\u201d, \u201coverwritten\u201d, \u201clinedThrough\u201d, \u201cbracketed\u201d, \u201cunderlined\u201d.\n* `@resp`: Indicates the editor responsible for identifying the hand of the deletion. The default will be the initials of the named editor(s) as they appear in the `<teiHeader>`, and need not be recorded.\n* `@hand`: Identifies the scribe responsible for the deletion. The default is the current scribal hand.\n\n### Attributes for `<damage>`:\n* `@type`: Describes the damage. Standard attribute values are \u201ctorn\u201d, \u201ccropped\u201d, \u201cfaded\u201d, \u201crubbed\u201d, \u201csmeared\u201d, \u201cstained\u201d, \u201coverbound\u201d, and \u201ccreased\u201d.\n* `@agent`: Signifies the cause of the damage. Standard attribute values are \u201ctorn\u201d and \u201cmildew\u201d.\n* `@extent`: Indicates the size of the damaged area. We have thus far used the imprecise unit of the space required for a character in the scribal hand, although the area affected may be described in inches, millimeters, folios, or whatever makes sense.\n* `@resp`: Refers to the transcriber who makes the decision about the existence, type, and extent of the damage. The default will be the initials of the named editor(s) as they appear in the <teiHeader> and need not be recorded.\n\n### Attributes for `<unclear>`:\n* `@reason`: Indicates why the material is hard to transcribe. Standard attribute values are \u201cill-formed\u201d, \u201ctorn\u201d, \u201cfaded\u201d, \u201crubbed\u201d, \u201csmeared\u201d, \u201coverbound\u201d, and \u201cstained\u201d.\n* `@resp`: Indicates the editor responsible for the transcription of the unclear text. The default will be the `@xml:id` of the named editor(s) as they appear in the `<teiHeader>` and need not be recorded.\n* `@cert`: Signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the unclear text. Values are \u201chigh\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d, and \u201clow\u201d.\n* `@hand`: Indicates the hand responsible for action that created the difficulty in transcription, where determinable.\n* `@agent`: Signifies the causative agent for the difficulty. Standard values include \u201cwater\u201d and \u201cmildew\u201d.\n* `@extent`: Indicates the number of characters that are ambiguous or illegible.\n\n### Attributes for `<supplied>`:\n\nSee the section on [Text Supplied by the Editor](05_The_text_Section/09_Editorial_Interventions/02_Text_Supplied_by_the_Editor).\n\n",

For modern editorial additions, `<supplied>` or `<corr>` should be used. Marginalia supplied by later hands is assumed to be an addition by the identification of its hand and does not need to be tagged as such.\n\n### Attributes for `<add>`:\n\n* `@place`: Designates the point at which the addition is made. The [*Piers Plowman Electronic Archive*](http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/seenet/piers/protocoltran.html) uses only the following values: \u201cinline\u201d, \u201csupralinear\u201d, \u201csublinear\u201d, \u201cmarginLeft\u201d, \u201cmarginRight\u201d, \u201ctopLeft\u201d, \u201ctopCenter\u201d, \u201ctopRight\u201d, \u201cbottomLeft\u201d, \u201cbottomCenter\u201d, and \u201cbottomRight\u201d.\n* `@hand`: Identifies the scribe who made the addition.\n* `@resp`: Identifies the editor or transcriber who identified the hand.

(There is also the possibility of using the attribute `@type`, but that would be used only if the added text is not on an original manuscript page.) Instead of the expected closing tag, `<addSpan/>` tags are bounded by an `<anchor/>` tag placed at the end of the span of added text.

The content of these tags may be either the characters that were deleted, if they are legible either under white or ultraviolet light, or symbolic if they are not legible. Symbolic representations of deleted characters should be supplied as follows: one period (.) per character up to five characters when it is possible to determine or guess the number of characters deleted, ...?... for deletions of six to a dozen characters, and ...?...?... for deletions of one half-line or more. Where multiple characters have been underdotted in the manuscript, only one `<del>` element is needed, unless the dotting represents separate acts of deletion.\n\nIf the deleted text is unclear, `<unclear>` tags may be nested within `<del>` tags. `<unclear>` tags give the option of expressing your degree of confidence in the reading. If the deleted text can be easily read, or, at the opposite extreme, cannot be read at all, there is no need to insert `<unclear>` tags.\n\nNote: The `<del>` tag will be followed by `<add>` tags where a scribe has deleted and then substituted text.\n\nFor standard attributes used with `<del>`, see the section under [Unclear or Illegible Characters](05_The_text_Section/06_Unclear_or_Illegible_Characters).\n",

Other types of content require a more nuanced approach. The `<choice>` element allows the two views to be formally separated. Typically, `<choice>` will contain an `<orig>` element, the content of which is the diplomatic representation, and a `<reg>` element, which represents the critical representation. In some cases, this formal separation requires some editorial decision-making. For instance, the word \u201cMan\u201d, when not at the beginning of a sentence or verse-line, may be tagged:\n\n```xml\n<choice>\n\t<orig>M</orig>\n\t<reg>m</reg>\n</choice>an\n\nor \n\n<choice>\n\t<orig>Man</orig>\n\t<reg>man</reg>\n</choice>\n```\n\nThat is, a decision is required as to whether to tag only the differing parts of the word or the word as a whole. The first example implies that the scribe was thinking in terms of letters (i.e. a capital letter would look nice here), whereas the second example implies that the scribe was thinking in terms of words (i.e. the word \u201cman\u201d has more semantic weight here). Although it is preferable for rendering purposes not to have stray characters outside of the `<choice>` element, as editors, we should adopt the method that best reflects our interpretation of the scribe\u2019s thinking.\n\nFor specific editorial policies on the handling of capital letters and abbreviations in diplomatic and critical views, see the appropriate sections under [Word-Level Representations](\u001d/Encoding_Policies/Word-Level_Representations) above.\n",

All notes must also be assigned an `@xml:id` number, and we will need to come up with a convention for naming note IDs, as well as our system of coordinating with the element to which the note refers. `@xml:id` values should be formed with room to expand: e.g. `ed0001`, `ed0002`, etc. They need not be human-readable within a line; we will want human readability for `@target` and `@targetEnd` if we use them coordinate. For example: `<note xml:id=\"ed0001\" target=\"#ch0001\" targetEnd=\"#pt0001\"/>` links to `<anchor xml:id=\"ch0001\"/>` and `<ptr xml:id=\"pt0001\"/>`.\n\nAEME requires the use of `@type` to indicate for all critical notes. The current taxonomy, derived from the <a href=\"http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/seenet/piers/protocoltran.html\" target=\"_blank\">*Piers Plowman Electronic Archive*</a>, consists of the following values: \u201ccod\u201d, \u201cpal\u201d, \u201cling\u201d, \u201clex\u201d, \u201chist\u201d, \u201csrc\u201d, \u201ctheo\u201d, \u201ctext\u201d, \u201cenc\u201d (short names for \u201ccodicological\u201d, \u201cpaleographic\u201d, \u201clinguistic\u201d, \u201clexical\u201d, \u201chistorical\u201d, \u201csource\u201d, \u201ctheological\u201d, \u201ctextual\u201d, and \u201cencoding\u201d). Note that the boundaries between \u201cling\u201d and \u201clex\u201d, \u201chist\u201d and \u201ctheo\u201d may be somewhat hard to determine.

For instance, `<note type=\"ling\" rend=\"dipl crit\">` would appear in the diplomatic view, as well as the critical view. Although an unlikely scenario, the formulation `<note type=\"ling\" rend=\"dipl\">` could be used to force a linguistic note to appear only in the diplomatic view.\n\nCross-references within the text may be indicated with the `<ref>` element.
