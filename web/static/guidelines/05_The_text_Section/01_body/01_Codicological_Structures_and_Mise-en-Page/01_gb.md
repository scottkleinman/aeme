# `gb`

To the extent that it is possible, editors should identify gathering or quire breaks in manuscripts and indicate them with `<gb/>`. The only required attributes are `@xml:id` and `@n`. The value of @n should be the number of the quire as listed in the manuscriptâ€™s collation formula (in whatever form that formula requires). The `<gb/>` element should be placed prior to any material in the page content.

At present, AEME does not employ a standard collation format.
