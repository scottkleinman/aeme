# `lb`

In facsimile and diplomatic markup, `<lb/>` should be placed at the beginning of each columnar line (including lines in single-column pages). The exception is where line breaks in the manuscript consistently align with poetic line breaks. In this case, the beginning `<l>` tag of a poetic line is assumed to be the beginning of a manuscript line.

The line break element `<lb/>` should also be used for line breaks in elements like forme work, glosses, and notes.
