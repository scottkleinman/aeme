The `<body>` element contains the main body of the text. Each text must be enclosed in at least one `<div1>` tag, and texts may be subdivided with multiple `<div2>` tags. Numbered div elements, along with child elements like `<note>`, `<pb/>`, and `<ref>`, should have `@xml:id`.

## Required Child Elements

`<div1>`

## AEME Requirements
Division tags can take many different types of child elements, and, at present, there are no editorial prescriptions on the elements available in AEME. Eventually, AEME should determine a taxonomy of allowable elements and lock them into oXygen.
