# `p`

The `<p>` element contains prose paragraphs. If the manuscript contains a paraph (pilcrow), it should be included by an entity representation inside the `<p>` element. We may wish to hide this entity in the critical view so that the text reads more like a standard student edition, whereas scholars may see the paraphs in the diplomatic view.
