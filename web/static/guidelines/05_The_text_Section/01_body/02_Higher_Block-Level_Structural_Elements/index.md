# Higher Block-Level Structural Elements

Block-level text structures on the page may loosely understood in terms of primary text and marginalia, although AEME recognises that there is not always a clear distinction. Textual marginalia are effectively defined as forme work, notes, references, and anonymous blocks by the Guidelines below. Anonymous blocks may be further subcategorised using `@type` to provide additional information about their function.
