An `<ab>` (Anonymous Block) element can be used to contain any textual content outside the main text without the semantic baggage of elements like `<p>`. This includes small marginalia as well as longer texts. It can be used with `@rend` to indicate the placement on the page with the following values: `topLeft`, `topCenter`, `topRight`, `leftMargin`, `rightMargin`, `bottomLeft`, `bottomCenter`, `bottomRight`. `@type` may be used to classify the type of material, such as “marginal-gloss”. AEME should maintain a taxonomy of values for this. Occasionally, it may be undesirable to designate text as marginal. In this case, `<ab type="secondary">` might be appropriate. It may even be possible to contain both texts in something like `<ab type="parallel">` to indicate their non-hierarchical relationship on the page.
