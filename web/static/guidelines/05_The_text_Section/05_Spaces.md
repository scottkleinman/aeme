# Spaces

Where a space has been deliberately left vacant for characters (most often seen where an intended ornamental capital was never made), the `<space/>` element is used. `<space/>` should not be used for spaces created by damage or deletion. Of the available attributes, AEME recommends that `<space/>` be accompanied at minimum by `@quantity` and `@unit` (lines, millimeters, or whatever is appropriate).
