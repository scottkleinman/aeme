# Roman Numerals

Roman numerals should be transcribed in their original form but identified as numbers with the `<num>` element. Pointing used to set off the number from the surrounding text should be included in the element. In order to make numerical quantities available for search, the Arabic numeral equivalent should be supplied using `@value`:

```xml
<num value="12">.xij.</num>
```
