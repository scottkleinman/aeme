# Allographs

Allographs are multiple forms of the same letter, which may or may not be significant to interpretation, depending upon the questions one is asking of the text. It is common practice, especially in student editions, to consolidate allographs into a single spelling. AEME permits the retention of all forms of letter in the facsimile view. In the diplomatic and critical markup views, allographs are merged into a single form, generally from the ASCII character set, except for those listed below.

* *i* and *j* are kept distinct in all views.
* Long *s* (ſ) and short *s* are kept distinct in the diplomatic view but consolidated as s in the critical view.
* *R* and round *r* (ꝛ) are kept distinct in the diplomatic view but consolidated as r in the critical view.

Editors who wish to make other distinctions may describe multiple forms of letters and give examples in a `<handNote>`.
