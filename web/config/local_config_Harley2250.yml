ABOUT: >
    <p>This is a demonstration of the digital edition
    platform for the Archive of Early Middle English. This version 
    includes material from London, British Library, Harley 2250. This 
    is an alpha version used for development purposes. Any 
    texts currently loaded are incomplete fragments used to test 
    functionality. Image loading time will vary depending on your 
    internet connection.</p><p>Clicking a word will open a dialog and 
    perform a simple search of the Middle English Dictionary, adding a 
    wildcard asterisk to the end of the word. Obviously, this will not 
    always produce the desired results, but eventually words can be 
    matched to MED IDs.</p>
